# ðŸš€ crypsol_logger

Structured and production-grade logger for your applications, with seamless AWS CloudWatch support and local fallback logging.

---

## ðŸ”¥ Features

- âœ… Structured JSON logging
- âœ… Batch and compress logs before sending
- âœ… AWS CloudWatch integration
- âœ… Automatic fallback to local stdout logging
- âœ… Thread-safe, high-performance design
- âœ… Minimal configuration required

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Add the crate to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
crypsol_logger = "0.1.0"
```
The `Level` enum is re-exported, so there's no need to add the `log` crate separately.

---

## ðŸ›  Setup & Usage

You can use the log! macro to generate logs. This macro will automatically check the environment variable and accordingly send logs to CloudWatch or print them to the console.

```rust
log!(Level::Info, "This is an info message");
log!(Level::Error, "This is an error message");
log!(Level::Debug, "Debugging information");
```

To log in a custom stream (other than info, error and debug) you can use log_custom macro

```rust
log_custom!(Level::Info,"Custom Stream Name", "This is the message and variable {variable}");
```

âœ… That's it! Logs are automatically captured and either sent to AWS CloudWatch or printed locally.
