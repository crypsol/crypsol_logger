# 🚀 crypsol_logger

Structured and production-grade logger for your applications, with seamless AWS CloudWatch support and local fallback logging.

---

## 🔥 Features

- ✅ Structured JSON logging
- ✅ Batch and compress logs before sending
- ✅ AWS CloudWatch integration
- ✅ Automatic fallback to local stdout logging
- ✅ Thread-safe, high-performance design
- ✅ Minimal configuration required

---

## 📦 Installation

Add the crate to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
crypsol_logger = "0.2.2"
```
The `Level` enum is re-exported, so there's no need to add the `log` crate separately.

## 🛠 Setup & Usage

You can use the log! macro to generate logs. This macro will automatically check the environment variable and accordingly send logs to CloudWatch or print them to the console.

```rust
log!(Level::Info, "This is an info message");
log!(Level::Error, "This is an error message");
log!(Level::Debug, "Debugging information");
```

You can also attach structured key-value fields to any log call. Just add a `;` after the message and pass your fields as `"key" => value` pairs:

```rust
log!(Level::Info, "User {} logged in", user_id; "ip" => ip_addr, "role" => role);
log!(Level::Error, "payment failed"; "order_id" => order_id, "amount" => amount);
```

This produces a JSON message like:

```json
{"message":"User 42 logged in","ip":"10.0.0.1","role":"admin"}
```

Plain string logs still work exactly the same — the structured fields are fully optional and backward-compatible.

To log in a custom stream (other than info, error and debug) you can use log_custom macro

```rust
log_custom!(Level::Info, "Custom Stream Name", "This is the message and variable {variable}");
log_custom!(Level::Info, "Payments", "charge created"; "tx" => tx_hash, "total" => total);
```

✅ That's it! Logs are automatically captured and either sent to AWS CloudWatch or printed locally.
